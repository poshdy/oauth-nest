Looking to add secure Google login to your NestJS application? Oauth2 provides a seamless way to authenticate users with their existing Google credentials. Here's a quick overview:

1. Google Cloud Setup:

Create a project on Google Cloud Platform
Enable the Google+ API
Create OAuth client ID credentials (Web Application type)
Define authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/redirect) 2. NestJS Configuration:

Install the @nestjs/passport and passport-google-oauth20 packages
Configure Passport.js in your NestJS module
Create a Google OAuth strategy using your client ID and secret 3. Login Flow:

User clicks "Login with Google" button
NestJS application redirects to Google login screen
Upon successful login, Google redirects back to your authorized URI with an authorization code
NestJS strategy exchanges the code for user profile information (name, email) 4. User Management:

Check if the user exists in your database based on profile information
If new user, register them
Benefits:

Secure and convenient login for users
Reduced user management overhead
Scalable authentication solution
